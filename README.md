it's an MLP game, using the Pygame library in Python.

the game is still very incomplete, with only one level, but I will be making updates soon.

if you want to help with development, feel free contact me:

To play, just run Python file: "menu.py".
When you open the menu, click on "Iniciar Jogo" to play or "Sair" to quit the game.

This game doesn't have an 'exe' yet, but I'll work on it in future updates.
Meanwhile, you need an IDE to run the Python file if you want to play.
